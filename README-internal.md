The voice recognition on your phone is a joke compared with OpenAI Whisper. You can use OpenAI Whisper in the ChatGPT Android and iOS apps for free. It will get even better when v3 hits the API. https://play.google.com/store/search?q=chatgpt&c=apps https://apps.apple.com/de/app/chatgpt/id6448311069
Because copy and pasting is a hassle and there is no pause button in the apps, I made myself a simple (free open source, no ads) page to edit text and use the OpenAI Whisper API. BUT there you need an OpenAI account, and it will cost you very little money: Whisper is dirt cheap: $0.036 / hour (rounded to the nearest second).

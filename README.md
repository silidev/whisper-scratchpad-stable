A page from which you can record speech and send to the OpenAI whisper API. The result is copied to the clipboard.

The API key is only stored in a cookie locally on your computer. You don't have to trust me on that, you can download this to your computer and run it there and check the very simple code.

- Run locally: See whisper-page.cmd
